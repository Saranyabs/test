Creating .bat file for running selenium server


Step 1: Create a new text file
Step 2: Open the file and type in following code into it (D:\Workspace-Helios should be changed to the path where selenium-server.jar file is copied) 
CD D:\Workspace-Helios
java -jar selenium-server.jar -multiWindow
(Don’t copy and paste as sometime it adds some special characters)
Step 3: Save it as “Selenium-server.bat”
Step 4: Still if you are not able to run, then execute both the commands in command prompt (Click Start -> Run ->cmd). If it is throwing any errors please let me know.
