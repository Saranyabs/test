Apache JMeter proxy Step-by-step
This tutorial attempts to explain the exact steps for JMeter's proxy. For those new to JMeter,
one easy way to create a test plan is to use the Proxy. What the proxy does is it records the
requests sent to the server.
Basic Proxy Instructions
1.
Go to
JMETER_HOME/bin
and start JMeter with
jmeterw.cmd
on Windows and
jmeter
on Linux/Unix
2.
Select “Test Plan” on the tree
3.
Right click on the “Test Plan” and add a new thread group:
Add > Threads (Users) >

Configure your brower to use the JMeter HTTP Proxy
At this point, JMeter's proxy is running. For this exercise, we will use Iceweasel/Firefox to
view some pages on JMeter.
13.
Start Iceweasel/Firefox, but do not close JMeter.
14.
From the tool bar, click “Edit -> Preferences” (or “Tools > Preferences”). This should bring
up the options.
15.
Select the “Advanced” tab, and “Network” tab
16.
Click “Settings” button near the bottom.
17.
On the new popup, check “Manual proxy configuration”. The address and port fields
should be enabled now.
18.
Address – enter “localhost” or the IP address of your system
19.
Port – enter “8080”.
20.
Check “Use this proxy server for all protocols”

Record your navigation
23.
With your brower, in the “Address” bar at the top, enter
“
http://jmeter.apache.org/index.html
” and hit the “enter” key.
24.
Click on a few links on JMeter's pages.
25.
Close your browser and bring up the JMeter window.
Expand the thread group and there should be several samplers. At this point, the test plan can
be saved as is. If you forget to add default http request settings, you will have to manually
delete the server name, and port.
In this sample, there aren't any default request parameters. If a particular request parameter

is required by all pages, the request defaults is where one would add the entries.
25.
Select “Thread Group”
26.
Right click “Add -> Listener -> Summary Report” to add an summary listener.
27.
The summary listener will show some basic statistics.
27.
Select “Thread Group”

Ramp up Period – do not change

Start the test
At this point, we are ready to run our test plan and see what happens. Save the test plan.
When you're ready to run the test, there's two ways:
1.
Run -> Start
2.
Ctrl–R
Before you start the test, select “Summary Report”. As the test runs, the statistics will change
until the test is done. At the end of the test, the summary report should look like this.
While the test is running, in the upper right-hand corner, there should be a green square.
When the test is done, the box should be grey.
